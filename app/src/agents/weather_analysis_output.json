    "Most Important": {
        "temperature": {
            "reason": "Current temperature at 28\u00b0C is suitable for the growing Sweet Corn, but if temperatures rise significantly, it could stress the plants, impacting growth and yield."
        },
        "humidity": {
            "reason": "Relative humidity at 83% is high, which can promote fungal diseases in crops, especially in Corn, which is currently growing. Monitoring is essential to prevent outbreaks."
        },
        "precipitation": {
            "reason": "No rainfall forecast, which can impact the irrigation needs of the growing Corn crop. Adequate water supply through drip irrigation is crucial to maintain optimal growth conditions."
        }
    },
    "Moderately Important": {
        "wind_speed": {
            "reason": "Wind speed at 3.1 m/s is moderate and should not pose a significant risk to crops. However, it can affect pollination in Corn if it increases."
        },
        "cloud_cover": {
            "reason": "Cloud cover at 45% indicates partial sunlight, which is generally beneficial for crops. However, excessive cloud cover could limit photosynthesis for the growing Corn."
        }
    },
    "Least Important": {
        "aqi": {
            "reason": "Air quality index at 177 indicates unhealthy levels which may affect livestock health and worker comfort, but it has less direct impact on crop growth."
        },
        "uv": {
            "reason": "UV index at 0 is currently low, posing minimal risk for sunburn on plants. However, it's essential for overall plant health and growth but less critical at this moment."
        }
